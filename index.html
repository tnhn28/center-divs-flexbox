                <h1>Hello.  My name is Tina.</h1>
                <p>I am learning the important skills of being a Responsive Designer and Developer.  I enjoy the challenge
                    of computer programming and am eager to learn.  I hope that I will be able to continue on and eventually
                    make this a career.

                <p>I live in Missouri, O'Fallon to be exact.  I have worked for the same manufacturing company for 21 years.
                    I'm starting to realize that I can/need to do more with my life.  My current job pays the bills, but the
                    physical and mental stress just doesn't make it feel worth it.  That is why I'm trying to get back into
                    programming.

            <div class="div-2">
                <p>I was first introduced to programming when I was a senior in high school. I thought it was so cool
                    that I could get the computer to ask for my name and then refer to me by my name.  I wish I could
                    have gotten involved sooner so I could get help in planning my future.  I took as many programming
                    languages that I could in my two years of college, but that wasn't enough to land me a programming
                    job. I know a lot has changed since then, but I'm eager to learn!

                <p>Fun Fact: I played ice hockey for about 15 years.  I mainly was a right winger, but sometimes played
                    center.  I was on a women's traveling team for 12-13 years and the last 10 years as the captain of 
                    the team.  It was a lot of fun.  There are times when I wish I was still playing.
